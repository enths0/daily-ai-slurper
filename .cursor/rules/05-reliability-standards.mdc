# Reliability Standards

## Error Recovery Principles
- All automation actions must have verification mechanisms
- Each module must implement proper timeout handling
- Critical operations should have fallback mechanisms

## Verification Requirements
- Screen capture must verify image data is valid
- Template matching must report confidence scores
- State transitions must verify successful completion
- Input actions must confirm their effects

## Logging Standards
- All modules must implement extensive logging
- Critical operations must log before and after execution
- Errors must be logged with complete context
- Performance metrics should be logged for optimization

## Resilience Design
- System should recover from most common error states
- Unexpected screens should be handled gracefully
- Connection issues should trigger retry mechanisms
- Game updates should be detected and reported

## Testing Requirements
- All recovery mechanisms must have dedicated tests
- Edge cases must be explicitly tested
- Regular execution should be monitored for stability
