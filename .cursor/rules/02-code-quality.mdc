# Code Quality Standards

## General Principles
- **Reliability First**: All components must handle failures gracefully
- **Readability Over Cleverness**: Favor explicit code over implicit
- **Testability**: Design components to be easily tested in isolation

## Python Standards
- Python 3.10+ required for all code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Type hints required for all function parameters and return values
- Docstring required for all classes and public methods

## Error Handling
- Use structured exception handling with specific exception types
- Log all exceptions with appropriate context
- Design recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- Always leave the system in a known state after exceptions

## Testing
- Unit tests required for all core components
- Integration tests for critical workflows
- Mocked game interfaces for testing state transitions

## Performance
- Optimize screen capture for minimal latency (<50ms)
- Template matching must complete within 100ms
- State transitions should be detected within 200ms
- Use region-of-interest optimization where possible
